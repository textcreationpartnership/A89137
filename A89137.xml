         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>ull,</hi> He ſent forth a Herauld to Command the Gates to be opened, and to have the town ſurrendred up; But He found the ſame Entertainment which his Majeſty had formerly.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer being returned to His Highneſſe, you cannot conceive but at ſo great a Repulle and denyall, he muſt bee
<pb facs="tcp:114931:3"/>very much moved. Wherupon immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſecond Meſſenger was ſent to the town, at which Summons Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> did preſently attend his Highneſſe from the Walls, to whom his Excellencie did deliver himſelf in this manner.</p>
            <p>That it was ſtrange that he againſt his <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> and muth contrary to the truſt and confidence which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had formerly repoſed in him, ſhould thus obſtinately both againſt Equity and Juſtice oppoſe his Majeſty, and conſtrain him to uſe ſuch violent means to obtain that, which he thought he might by His Power and Right Command.</p>
            <p>And withall enformed him, that now it was no time for diſpute, but walled him to ſurrender up the Town, which he ſo long had detained from his Majeſty, which if he would do, and ſubmit himſelf unto his Royall Clemency, happily His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, out of his tender Aflection which He alwayes bore to the informities of His Subjects, which he is ſenſible may be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:114931:3"/>miſled, might indulge theſe his yet Contumelious Errours, and in hope of his future amendment forget, and forgive his former Errours, and reſtore him to all thoſe Liberties and Fortunes he formerly enjoyed.</p>
            <p>After His Highneſſe had thus delivered himſelf, Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> after ſome ſmall pauſe, but ſerious Conſideration, in all humble manner thus expreſt himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Highneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let your Excellence be pleaſed to ſend a patient Ear unto your moſt faithgull ſervants defence, whoſe Loyall intentions have alwayes beene, and ever ſhall be moſt zealous to ſerve your moſt Royall Father, and next ofter him your Excellence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I could wiſh both my Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes certiople, that by the free Expenſe of them I might teſtifie the Gratitude and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Duty, which I owe unto your moſt Royall Father, and my moſt Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114931:4"/>
You cannot taxe me of ſuch fowle and hainous Crimes, as the <hi>Malignant Party</hi> do object againſt me, when you ſhall rightly conſider that all my endeavours have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for the priviledge of the Subject, and the ſecurity of the Kingdom, no wais impugning the <hi>Prerogatives which belong to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certain it is, that both your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Self, and alſo all the world may juſtly condemn me of Infidelity, if I ſhould tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly deceive that truſt, which the Supream and Higheſt Court of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath entruſted me withall, and in the Breach wherof may inſue the generall Ruine of this Nation.</p>
            <p>A truſt of ſo great weight and high Conſequence cannot be deceived, but a heavie diſcredit muſt of neceſſity brand him, who ſhall give the occaſion of that breach.</p>
            <p>So far is from me the very thought of diſloyalty, that if it ſhall pleaſe that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, who did firſt commit that truſt to me, to conſent with my ſelf, I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:114931:4"/>all freedom of mind, and Loyalty of hart give up both the Town, and my ſelf, and all that I may properly call mine unto his Majeſty, and humbly proſtrate both them and my ſelf at His Majeſties feet, not doubting, but upon His juſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration, he may not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my Errours, if any in this caſe have bin committed, but alſo command my fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and out of his clemency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thinke mee fit to ſerve His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> having delivered himſelf, but keeping the town, the Prince left him for the preſent, and we do expect that His Highneſſe ſhould levie a Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palſgrave</hi> is gone from <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to take up forces, and to repair to <hi>Hull</hi> with all ſpeed he can.</p>
            <p>The King himſelf is gone from us, and with the next <hi>Tueſday</hi> night be at <hi>Newark</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> and from thence he will goe to <hi>Lieceſter:</hi> Thus I reſt,</p>
